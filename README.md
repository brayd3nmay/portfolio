Brayden â€” Small-business website redesign portfolio
===================================================

Tech: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4, ESLint 9, Prettier 3, next-sitemap.

Quick start
-----------

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # next dev --turbopack

npm run build
npm run start

npm run lint
npm run format
npm run typecheck
```

SEO
---
- `next-sitemap` runs after build to generate `public/sitemap.xml` and `public/robots.txt`.

Notes
-----
- Static-only site. No backend, no API routes.
- Sitemap and robots are generated by `next-sitemap` on build into `public/`.
- Security headers and CSP are set in `next.config.ts`.
- Images use Next Image and prefer AVIF/WebP. Placeholder SVGs are included for before/after.
- Tradeoffs: kept the CSP permissive enough for Next dev (`unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval`) but still locked to self for sources. Simple placeholder visuals instead of heavy libraries to keep perf high.
